1) In my project, I developed a replica of Twitter using React for the front-end and Django for the back-end. One of the key features of the project was the implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, which ensured that only authenticated users could post tweets on the website. I utilized ChakraUI, a highly customizable and accessible UI library for React, to create a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface for the website. ChakraUI's wide range of reusable components and its adherence to accessibility guidelines made it the perfect choice for designing the website's layout and elements. Overall, the project was a challenging and rewarding experience, as it allowed me to apply my knowledge of React and Django to create a functional and visually appealing replica of the popular social media platform, Twitter. The implementation of JWT authentication and the use of ChakraUI to design the website's layout and elements were key highlights of the project.

2) For the front-end features, I decided to implement all three features since I used the components, created mobile responsiveness, and user Profile pages. For the back-end features, I have also implemented all three features because I created JWT user registration / login / logout functionality, integrated the website with an SQLite database, and made it so it's possible to make API calls. I have also linked the back-end with the front-end to make the previous features possible and enhance the functionality of the twitter website.

3) I spent approximately 5-6 hours working on this project. A couple of those hours went on creating 
a pretty design for the website because I wanted to develop an aesthetic feel for my Twitter replica.

4) Since I spent most my time working on the primary front end and back end features, I did not have any time to implement the proposed misc features. However, implemeting the misc features would not be difficult because in order to implement searching for users, I would have to create a search bar and make an API call to the db to filter the users based on the input in the search bar textbox. To implement Tweet filtering, I would have to add another model field for my Tweet model and, similarly, make an API call to obtain all tweets and only display those that are necessary.

5) I made a YouTube video displaying the behavior of my twitter replica website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYre3onqc0
